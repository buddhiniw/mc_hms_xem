The structure of mc_hms_single is now very similar to SIMC, and most
of the code can be taken from the SIMC version of the spectrometer MCs.
The single-arm specific files you need are:

  mc_hms_single.f		!main routine
  Makefile			!the makefile
  simulate.inc			!single arm version of SIMC's simulate.inc
				! (declares some decay-related variables).
  infiles/<filename>.inp	!An input file.


The other fortran, include, and data files are copies of the SIMC versions (do
NOT copy over the SIMC version of simulate.inc).  You will need the following
routines:
  constants.inc
  spectrometers.inc
  gauss1.f
  mt19937.f
  loren.f
  hms/*
  shared/*


To convert to another spectrometer, you will need to do the following:

  1. Change the hSTOP.* variables to match the struct_<spec>.inc structure.
  2. Modify multiple scattering which is hardwired in main routine.
  3. Change ntuple variable names, if desired.


TO DO:	Fast raster (currently set to zero for call to mc_hms)
	Transformation from target to TRANSPORT system assumes spec on right(left)
