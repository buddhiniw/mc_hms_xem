  MC_HMS_XEM  -  Hall C single arm montecarlo for inclusive reactions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

mc_hms_single.f is a stripped down and modified version of the SIMC (Hall C Monte Carlo) to 
perform single arm monte carlo for inclusive reactions.

mc_hms_single is setup to simulate the optics (using COSY models) and apertures of the Hall C High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS). 
It includes:
* Radiative effects, multiple scattering, ionization energy loss and
  particle decay are included
* Simple presecriptions are available for Final State Interactions,
  Coulomb Corrections and other effects.

THE STRUCTURE:

The structure of mc_hms_single is very similar to SIMC, and most
of the code are taken from the SIMC version of the spectrometer MCs.
The single-arm specific files are:

  mc_hms_single.f		!main routine
  Makefile			!the makefile
  simulate.inc			!single arm version of SIMC's simulate.inc
				! (declares some decay-related variables).
  infiles/<filename>.inp	!An input file.


The other fortran, include, and data files are copies of the SIMC versions (do
NOT copy over the SIMC version of simulate.inc).  You will need the following
routines:
  constants.inc
  spectrometers.inc
  gauss1.f
  mt19937.f
  loren.f
  hms/*
  shared/*

The outputs are stored in:
    outfiles/infile_name.out
    
The hbook file is saved in:
    worksim/infile_name.rzdat


To convert mc_hms_single to be used for another spectrometer, you will need to do the following:

  1. Change the hSTOP.* variables to match the struct_<spec>.inc structure found inside hms_simc/ folder
  2. Modify multiple scattering which is hardwired in main routine.
  3. Change ntuple variable names, if desired.



TO USE:

Make sure you have the correct infiles and the worksim files in your directories.
Compile using gmake
Do
./mc_hms_single
 Enter input filename (assumed to be in infiles dir)
18deg_carbon_5100    
 open infiles
 infiles/18deg_carbon_5100.inp
